Tasked with transitioning from a static menu on the front-end to a dynamic back-end based system that could be edited and allow for rotating daily and holiday specials, I created new database models and API endpoints, solved UI bugs related to the restructuring, and created additional admin features to implement the new CRUD functionality. This project presented unique challenges, such as complex data restructuring and integrating changes into existing live applications. It provided valuable experience in debugging, problem-solving, and project architecture.",
